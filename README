wp-gopher 0.2 (special LCA 2009 edition)


Description
-----------

Provides, in conjunction with an inetd superserver, a Gopher interface to
Wordpress 2.2 and later. (Valid as of Wordpress 2.7, anyway.)


Requirements
------------

- Some sort of *nix. I've tested it on Linux, but really, anything should do.
- Python 2.4 or later.
- Python-MySQLdb 1.2 or later.
- A Wordpress installation with a database layout compatible with WP 2.2-2.7.


Installation
------------

1. Copy wp-gopher.py to a suitable location. /usr/local/sbin would probably do.
2. Copy wp-gopher.ini.dist to /etc/wp-gopher.ini and alter the variables to
   those matching the Wordpress installation.
3. Set up inetd to pass gopher requests to wp-gopher.py. The supplied
   gopher.xinetd file can be used to configure xinetd, assuming wp-gopher.py is
   installed in /usr/local/sbin.
4. Reload (x)inetd and enjoy.


Problems, Reports, Patches

Notes
-----

- It's weird talking about yourself in the third person (see above).
- This is technically correct. The best kind of correct.
- No, I don't know why I wrote this either.
